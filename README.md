### Description

This is just a very basic beginner's tutorial for using ADO to connect to a database. Trust me, there are more comments than code!

Please leave comments, as they help me grow! I won't beg for votes, but they also help me grow. I'd like to create more database tutorials, but need to know how to improve for future versions.
 
### More Info
 
This only retrieves data, since it is a beginner's guide. More of a foot-in-the-door to help out anyone who knows nothing about connecting to databases.
